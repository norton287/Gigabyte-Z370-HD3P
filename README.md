# Gigabyte-Z370-HD3P
SSDT for USBInjectAll and Clover EFI Folder for Gigabyte **Z370 HD3P** with an **I7-8700K** CPU.  I am currently running the **F10** bios with no problems with macOS 10.14.3 installed.  Sleep/Wake works well and I have Power Nap running as well.

I am using a ***Sapphire RX580 Pulse*** video card and have the iGPU configured to run headless.

Here is my hardware installed:

- I7-8700K CPU (Overclocked to 4.9Ghz)
- Kingston Technology HyperX Fury Black 32GB 2666MHz DDR4 CL16 DIMM Kit of 2 (HX426C16FBK2/32)
- Samsung 970 EVO 1TB NVMe PCIe M.2 2280 SSD (MZ-V7E1T0BW) (Primary macOS drive)
- 2 Samsung 960 EVO 1TB SSD (One for Windows and the other for my second macOS installation)
- PCI-E Wifi Adapter BCM943602CDâ€“ 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac
- Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo (RR-212E-20PK-R2) CPU Cooler with PWM Fan, Four Direct Contact Heat Pipes
- Rosewill Gaming ATX Full Tower Computer Case Cases THOR V2 Black

For my BIOS settings see the [BIOS](BIOS.md) settings information.  I would not update to the F11b BIOS as I have not been able to get my system to boot with it at all.

## macOS Beta

I am running macOS Beta 10.14.4 on my secondary installation without any issues so far.
