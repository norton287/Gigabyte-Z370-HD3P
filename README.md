# Gigabyte-Z370-HD3P
SSDT for USBInjectAll and Clover Config.plist I am using for Gigabyte **Z370 HD3P** with an **I7-8700K** CPU.  I am currently running the **F10** bios with no problems with macOS 10.15.4 installed.  Sleep/Wake works well and I have Power Nap running as well.

**To upgrade to macOS 10.4.4 with IGPU running in headless with a discrete GPU as your main driver, you need to delete the device entry in your config.plist and remove the Platform ID.  Also, you want to check Inject Intel as well.**

I am using a ***Sapphire RX580 Pulse*** video card and have the iGPU configured to run headless.

Here is my hardware installed:

- I7-8700K CPU (Overclocked to 4.9Ghz)
- Kingston Technology HyperX Fury Black 32GB 2666MHz DDR4 CL16 DIMM Kit of 2 (HX426C16FBK2/32)
- 2 Samsung 970 EVO 1TB NVMe PCIe M.2 2280 SSD (MZ-V7E1T0BW) (Primary macOS drive and one for my Home directory on macOS)
- 2 Samsung 960 EVO 1TB SSD (One for Windows and the other for my second macOS installation)
- PCI-E Wi-Fi Adapter BCM943602CDâ€“ 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac
- Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo (RR-212E-20PK-R2) CPU Cooler with PWM Fan, Four Direct Contact Heat Pipes
- Rosewill Gaming ATX Full Tower Computer Case Cases THOR V2 Black

For my BIOS settings see the [BIOS](BIOS.md) settings information.  GA released the F12 bios last month, and like F11b it does not boot with an M.2 NVME drive.  The macOS NVME driver fails to load on boot.

## macOS Beta

I am running macOS 10.5.5 Developer Beta 1 now since resolving how to do the update when it fails to present the PreBooter for install.

To update to the 10.5.5 beta 1 just boot to clover and press F11 to clear NVRAM.  Then boot into macos and let the System Preference Updater download and start the install.  Reboot and you should see the PreBooter with the Install macOS signature.
