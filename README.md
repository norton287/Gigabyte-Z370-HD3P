# Gigabyte-Z370-HD3P
SSDT for USBInjectAll and Clover Config.plist I am using for Gigabyte **Z370 HD3P** with an **I7-8700K** CPU.  I am currently running the **F10** bios with no problems with macOS 10.15.1 Beta 2 installed.  Sleep/Wake works well and I have Power Nap running as well.

**To upgrade to macOS 10.4.4 with IGPU running in headless with a discrete GPU as your main driver, you need to delete the device entry in your config.plist and remove the Platform ID.  Also, you want to check Inject Intel as well.**

I am using a ***Sapphire RX580 Pulse*** video card and have the iGPU configured to run headless.

Here is my hardware installed:

- I7-8700K CPU (Overclocked to 4.9Ghz)
- Kingston Technology HyperX Fury Black 32GB 2666MHz DDR4 CL16 DIMM Kit of 2 (HX426C16FBK2/32)
- 2 Samsung 970 EVO 1TB NVMe PCIe M.2 2280 SSD (MZ-V7E1T0BW) (Primary macOS drive and one for my Home directory on macOS)
- 2 Samsung 960 EVO 1TB SSD (One for Windows and the other for my second macOS installation)
- PCI-E Wi-Fi Adapter BCM943602CDâ€“ 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac
- Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo (RR-212E-20PK-R2) CPU Cooler with PWM Fan, Four Direct Contact Heat Pipes
- Rosewill Gaming ATX Full Tower Computer Case Cases THOR V2 Black

For my BIOS settings see the [BIOS](BIOS.md) settings information.  GA released the F12 bios last month, and like F11b it does not boot with an M.2 NVME drive.  The macOS NVME driver fails to load on boot.

## macOS Beta

I am running macOS 10.15.1 Developer Beta 2 on my secondary installation with some issues so far.  Catalina is not detecting my 4K TV so it only allows scaling.  I did discover that it is loading with the 4K Apple Logo with Beta 2 and my windows aren't all messed up anymore on loading the UI.
